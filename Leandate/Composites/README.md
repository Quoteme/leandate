# Composites

All _composite_ datatypes are defined here. A _composite_ datatype is one, that
consists of one or more of the basic datatypes defined in this library.
For example, `Date` is a composite datatype, because it consists of `Day`, `Month`
and `Year`.

For basic datatypes, see the [Units](../Units/README.md) directory.
