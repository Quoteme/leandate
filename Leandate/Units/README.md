# Units

All _basic_ datatypes are defined here. A _basic_ datatype is one, which does
not consist of other datatypes defined in this library. For example, `Day` is
a basic datatype, but `Date` is not, because it consists of `Day`, `Month` and
`Year`.

For composite datatypes, see the [Composites](../Composites/README.md) directory.
